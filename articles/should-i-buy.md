title: Should I buy a PC?

I will admit, PC gaming is not for everyone. This page should help you decide whether to take the plunge

## Price

Cost is the biggest problem in PC gaming. PCs are incredibly expensive compared to phones, consoles and other alternatives. A mid-range gaming PC can cost between $1000 and $2000, and that's not factoring in the cost of the OS, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and more. Since PC games are rarely purchased physically, you are unable to buy pre-owned games and always have to pay full price.

An important note is that console gaming is nowhere near as cheap as it used to be. As of writing, a PS5 costs $800, and it still is suffering from regular price hikes. Consoles also require expensive subscriptions to play games online with your friends. Put that on top of Spotify and Netflix subscriptions, you are emptying your pockets every month for entertainment. On PC, most games are one-time purchases, and do not require sneaky subscriptions to play.

If you are comfortable with the cost of PC's, then you have passed the biggest gatekeeper.

## Convenience

PCs are not very convenient. Unless you are buying a laptop, your PC is in one spot permanently. In that area, you need to have access to either high-speed Wi-Fi or an Ethernet Cable. You also need to get one "PC desk" with your keyboard, mouse, monitor on it.

## Performance

If you buy a lower budget PC, there is no guarantee that you can run every game you want to. PCs are constantly evolving, and that means newer games will have larger spec requirements than your current build has, so your PC will have less and fewer games available.

Consoles, on the other hand, do not suffer from this issue. If a game is available on your console, it is guaranteed it will run well. Games are specifically optimised for that console. Since there are so many PCs, and so many parts in each PC, a game developer cannot properly optimise games for your system.

## Ease of use

Compared to consoles, PCs are quite difficult to use. On a console, you either go to your game store, download a game, and play the game or go to a shop, buy the disc, and play the game. It is that simple. On PC, you need to download a game market, run the executable, give it appropriate permissions, install it, run the app, make an account, buy the game you want, download it, start it, realise you didn't install the right display drivers, reinstall your display drivers, reboot, then finally play the game. Yes, this is more complicated than it often is, but it has happened to me. The point is that PC gaming isn't consistent or guaranteed, and you do need to use your brain sometimes to solve problems. If you want everything to "just work", use a console.

So, if you are still confident that you want to game on a PC, it is time to get into the basics.
