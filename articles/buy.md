## Budget

First, you have to choose a budget for your setup. Simply put, the more you pay, the better PC you get.

A good starting budget is $1200 (AUD). For that price, you can get an entry-level gaming PC that can play most games relatively well. PCs will gradually get better until you hit the $5000 dollar mark, where you are getting the best of the best. 

My PC costed $1100, but that was before the [chip shortage](https://www.pcmag.com/news/inside-the-gpu-shortage-why-you-still-cant-buy-a-graphics-card) that has made everything more expensive. Thankfully, [the Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) has caused most miners to sell their high end GPUs, and since miners aren't buying as many GPUs scalpers aren't scalping as many, so all GPU prices are dropping. That means soon you might actually be able to buy a recent GPU for its MSRP (original price), or get an even cheaper one second hand from a miner.

If you do need to go much cheaper, there are options below $500, but be warned, it is risky. To get a PC that cheap you need to get second hand parts, and in this market second hand is always risky. There is a chance they are selling you completely broken parts, or parts they have worn out/not cared for. You could get performance significantly worse than the card was intended for because of this. If you do want to go the second hand route, make sure you are careful.

## Laptop, Pre-built or Custom

Laptops are portable and easy to set up. They are also mass-produced by a big company, who will usually offer great support and warranty. They are good for someone who wants their system to "just work", as they do a lot of the hard work for you. Despite all of that, laptops are not perfect. They are infamous for higher price compared to their desktop counterparts. While this is true, it is without mentioning that for a PC you need to buy more than the computer itself. You also need a keyboard, a mouse, a desk, a monitor and more. After you factor in the costs of those components, the price isn't that different. Laptops also are hard if not impossible to upgrade, because everything is so closely integrated and compacted to fit into a laptop. The last big problem is that laptop parts are often bottle necked by the laptop itself, since it needs to manage the battery. Some would say the solution is just to always keep it plugged in, but that rapidly degrades the battery of the computer.

Custom PCs are what most professional gamers use. They actually buy all the parts and build it themselves. Since you are the manufacturer, you get to choose every part of the system. You can choose the specs to be the best for your budget, you can take advantage of individual parts being on sale, and you can upgrade it when you want to for as long as you want to. Custom PCs are often cheaper than the other options, as you can buy second parts. They can also be faster, because you can buy hardware designed for overclocking. They are not a solution for everyone, though. Building a PC is not an easy process, and once you install, you do not have the manufacturer support you get from a laptop. You do not always have to make a custom PC yourself, though. There are companies which build PCs with parts you choose, therefore bringing all the advantages of a custom PC without the hassle of building. That comes at the cost of, well, the actual cost. Buying a custom-built PC means you are not just paying for the PC, but also paying people to build it. That's how I got my PC, from a company called [Techfast](https://techfast.com.au/).

Pre-built PCs are the middle ground between the two. You buy a desktop PC from a company who (usually) offers support and warranty. (Most) prebuilt computers are still upgradable and powerful. They are usually more expensive than it would be to build yourself, because you are also paying the manufacturing costs. 

If you do not care about portability, I think you should get either a pre-built or order a custom-built PC. If portability is something you really care about, then go with a laptop.

## Hyper Budget 

If you want a hyper low-budget PC, LinusTechTips made a great video series on, where he bought an old pre-built PC  with some very helpful suggestions. Once again, I recommend you be cautious when buying second hand parts.
