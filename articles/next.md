Now, you have a PC. You know the basics of gaming and have some games installed. Where do you go from now?

## Customisation

There are so many ways to customise your computer, past the basic changes like changing your wallpaper. It is not all that relevant to this website, so I will not go into great detail. A cool alternative to classic wallpapers is [Lively](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/) (Free) or [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) (Paid) for dynamic, live wallpapers. Another cool thing to look into is [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/), a cool desktop widget program for windows.

You can also install Windows themes from [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/favourites/78918060/windows-10-themes) and [ThemePack](https://themepack.me/) with tools like [UltraUXThemePatcher](https://mhoefs.eu/software_uxtheme.php?lang=en). (I have not checked the security of these programs and themes, use at your own risk!)

For more inspiration, check out [Tanjim The Tech Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channael/UCps7ALyzFBfCf2euc7RjTBA) on YouTube, he has made some amazing desktops and makes tutorials for them all.

## MORE OPTIMISATION!

I was only able to list so many optimisation techniques that I use, there are still thousands more. It is very much worth you doing your own research on how to optimise your computer more. This website will also quickly become outdated, so more cool optimisations will appear in the future for you to discover.

## Try Linux

Once you feel you have mastered Windows, many people would want a new challange. I think the best place to go there is trying out Linux. I suggest you try out [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) in a virtual machine. It is easy to use, and has a Windows-esc UI. [Here is a good guide on installing by It's Foss](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-mint-in-virtualbox/)

Linux is hundreds of times more powerful and customisable than Windows or macOS. There is so much to learn in the Linux space. I will let you do your own research if you want to.

## Just keep learning

There is so much more to know about computers, more than anyone could put into one website (apart from maybe YouTube or Wikipedia). I suggest you just keep researching over time. There is so much to learn!
