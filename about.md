Welcome to my website! This site was made by Dispatch with advice from TheMan and others. I made this site to be helpful for newbies and tech pros alike, I hope you found some of it useful.

Due to repeated issues with embeds, I made the decision to proxy all YouTube videos through [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks). This not only improves the back-end (Piped is much easier to work with), but will also improve your user experience. Piped does not serve ads, and includes SponsorBlock (a community project to record all sponsor segments and automatically skip then). This does come at a cost, because some places block Piped as it can be used to bypass content restrictions. 


## Credits 
All screenshots (exept for macOS and Linux ones) were taken by me. All videos were taken from YouTube, exept for the Rainmeter example desktop, which was created by The_siderian. All articles were written exclusivly by me. The Moonwalk Jekyll theme was created by abhinavs under the MIT license.
